# Design Sorting Visualizer
I created this project from the assignments assigned to me in my training in Gaza sky Geeks.

# Summary 
The project is a graphic model that shows the process of arranging the array by moving the columns of the graph, and the arrangement is done using the Bubble Sort Algorithm.

# Brief Presentation

At the beginning of running the code, the Array appears unordered, as shown in the following figure
